# rpi-setup-tool
This Installer guides you through the Installation of some standard packages I created and
makes the Setup of a Pi in General easier and faster.

I'm not an expert Coder so use this Repo on your own Risk and don't blame me if you have to reinstall your Raspberry.

If you find something interesting within my Scripts feel free to copy parts of it and implement it into your own code.
Also feel free to contribute to this Repository and make it better :)
